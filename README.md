Dataset Analysis Report – Titanic Dataset
Objective:
This report analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand its structure, data types, data quality, and suitability for machine learning.


 Dataset Overview:
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details, ticket information, and survival outcomes. Each row represents a passenger, and each column represents an attribute related to that passenger. The dataset is widely used for binary classification problems in machine learning.


Dataset Structure and Data Types:
The dataset consists of several hundred records, making it suitable for machine learning tasks. It includes both numerical features such as age, fare, and passenger class, and categorical features such as gender, embarkation port, and cabin information.


Target Variable:
The target variable in this dataset is 'Survived', which indicates whether a passenger survived the disaster. It is a binary variable, making the dataset suitable for classification models.


Missing Values and Data Quality:
The dataset contains missing values in certain columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked. These missing values highlight the need for preprocessing techniques such as imputation or feature removal before applying machine learning algorithms.


Class Distribution and ML Suitability:
The target variable shows class imbalance, with more passengers not surviving than surviving. Despite this imbalance, the dataset is clean, well-structured, and appropriate for machine learning after necessary preprocessing and handling of imbalance.


Conclusion:
The Titanic dataset is a well-known and structured dataset suitable for machine learning. With proper handling of missing values, categorical encoding, and class imbalance, it can be effectively used to build predictive classification models.
